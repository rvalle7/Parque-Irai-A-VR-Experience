# Parque-Irai-A-VR-Experience
An VR experience from a 3D project i did originally in Maya and rendered in video with camera track over 4k drone images.

Hello, so i' new here, and comming back to code from a long logn time ago, when i code in MSX Expert, at home, in Basic.
I will put here some of my code that i' using to evolve on my VR experience.
Some are only to pull things in physics, others to change the foodsteps sound effects in diferent scenarios and so on.
Everything i need to complete the vr experience will be here.
In proper time, i will made public all Unity assets, so you will be able to run on or machine too, but for now, only the codes in C#, for Unity 3D (5.5.0f3, the version i use)
So, fell free to use it, change it and sugest what you want.
Is a free channel.

Cheers!
